#**EXPERIMENT 9 : Study of NumPy Library**

##*AIM*: **To study the NumPy library in Python and understand various array operations, attributes, and built-in mathematical functions.** 

*THEORY*: 

1. NumPy: NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library used for numerical computations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently.

2. Array: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.

3. Dimension (ndim): It returns the number of dimensions (axes) of the array.

1D array → ndim = 1

2D array → ndim = 2

4. Shape

It returns the number of elements in each dimension.

For 1D → (number of elements,)

For 2D → (rows, columns)

5. Data Type (dtype): It shows the type of elements stored in the array (e.g., int32, float64).

6. Size: It returns the total number of elements in the array.
