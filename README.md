#**EXPERIMENT 9 : Study of NumPy Library**

##*AIM*: **To study the NumPy library in Python and understand various array operations, attributes, and built-in mathematical functions.** 

*THEORY*: 

1. NumPy: NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library used for numerical computations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently.

2. Array: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.

3. Dimension (ndim): It returns the number of dimensions (axes) of the array.

4. Shape: It returns the number of elements in each dimension.

5. Data Type (dtype): It shows the type of elements stored in the array (e.g., int32, float64).
6. Size: It returns the total number of elements in the array.
7. Zeros: Creates an array filled with zeros.
8. Ones: Creates an array filled with ones.
9. Eye: Creates an identity matrix (diagonal elements are 1 and others are 0).

Syntax: np.eye(n)

10. Arange: Returns evenly spaced values within a given interval.

11. Linspace: Returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.
12. Arithmetic Operations: NumPy allows element-wise operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

Example:

a + 5
b * 2

13. Mean (np.mean()): Returns the average of array elements.

14. Median (np.median()): Returns the middle value after sorting the elements.

15. Standard Deviation (np.std()): Measures how much the elements deviate from the mean.

16. Maximum (np.max()): Returns the largest value in the array.

17. Minimum (np.min()): Returns the smallest value in the array.

18. Sum (np.sum()): Returns the total sum of all elements.

19. Transpose (np.transpose()): Converts rows into columns and columns into rows.

20. Sort (np.sort()): Returns a sorted copy of the array.

*Conclusion:*
Thus, we successfully studied the NumPy library and performed various operations such as array creation, finding dimensions, shape, size, data type, and applying mathematical functions like mean, median, standard deviation, sum, maximum, minimum, transpose, and sorting. NumPy makes numerical computations faster and more efficient in Python.
